# Mayfly

Mayfly is the Reaver Project's testing framework. It's meant to be lightweight and
benefit from as many modern C++ features as possible. Primary goals are for Mayfly
to be fast, generate readable outputs (and TeamCity-ready results) and later get
closely integrated with Despayre, the Reaver Project's build system.
